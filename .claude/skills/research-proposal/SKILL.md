# Research Proposal Generator

Generate a forward-looking academic research proposal — a plan for research not yet done — following flagship academic writing conventions, in English or Chinese.

This skill produces the **first draft correctly**, not a template to be fixed later. Its single most important discipline is citation integrity: a proposal with a fabricated reference is an academic-integrity problem, not a style problem. Read [references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md](references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md) before Phase 2.

## Core Principles

**Prose first.** Proposals read as flowing, connected paragraphs — not bulleted lists. Reserve lists for a focused set of research questions/objectives (2–4 items) and timeline milestones. Never enumerate contributions, methodology, background, or significance as bullets; narrate them. Full rules and examples: [references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**Every citation verified before it is committed.** Reference count follows the argument, never a quota — there is no minimum. A PhD proposal typically cites 25–50 sources (humanities often more); a tightly argued 25 beats a padded 45. Every reference must exist (DOI/PMID/arXiv resolves, or Zotero metadata), with author and year matching the source, before it enters the proposal. Unverifiable references are flagged `[UNVERIFIED]` and disclosed — never fabricated. See [references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md](references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md).

**Write with verification, not one-shot.** Draft section by section; verify each section's citations before moving to the next (Phase 4). Do not generate a full multi-section proposal with dozens of citations in a single pass — that is the structural cause of hallucinated references.

**Hedge to the evidence.** Use tentative language ("aims to", "may", "is expected to") for proposed work and uncertain claims; state well-established facts plainly. Do not over-claim ("will prove", "revolutionize").

**Avoid the LLM tells.** These phrases are AI-detector signatures — strip them: "Over the past decade, X has emerged as…", "In recent years,", "It is worth noting that", "plays a crucial/pivotal role", "has garnered significant attention", "delves into", "a testament to". Write specific openings grounded in the actual field instead of generic scene-setting.

## Scenario Routing

The default structure below targets **PhD/doctoral proposals and academic research plans** (Abstract → Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Timeline → Significance). Confirm the scenario in Phase 1 and adapt:

| Request | Structure |
|---|---|
| PhD/doctoral proposal, research plan, 研究计划书 | Default structure (this skill) |
| 开题报告 (thesis proposal / defense) | Default structure, but weight Literature Review and feasibility/existing-basis more heavily; keep methodology concrete |
| Humanities dissertation proposal | Default + a **Chapter Outline** section (see [references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md](references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md)) |
| 基金申请书 / 国自然 / NSF grant | **Different structure** (立项依据 / 研究内容与目标 / 研究方案与可行性 / 研究基础与工作条件 / 经费预算). Tell the user the default 5-section template is not a grant form; adapt headings to the funder's required template and confirm with the user before writing |

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect:

- **Research topic / question** — core problem to investigate.
- **Scenario** — PhD proposal / 开题报告 / research plan / grant (routes structure, see above).
- **Academic domain** — STEM (and whether computational/ML — see [references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md](references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md)), Humanities, or Social Sciences.
- **Output language** — English or 中文.
- **Target word count** — default ~3,000 words; range 2,000–4,000 (humanities may extend to ~10,000).
- **Optional** — target institution/supervisor; existing materials or a Zotero library to draw on.

If the topic is too vague to scope a methodology, ask focused clarifying questions before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Literature Collection (with verification gate)

Read [references/LITERATURE_WORKFLOW.md](references/LITERATURE_WORKFLOW.md) for search strategy and organization.

**Tool portability.** Confirm which tools are available before using tool-specific names. Prefer the user's Zotero library (via the `mcp__zotero__*` tools) for closed-access papers; use `WebSearch` for landscape/trends and `WebFetch` to open DOI / PubMed / arXiv pages and confirm metadata. If a Zotero/arXiv/PubMed MCP is not connected, fall back to `WebSearch` + `WebFetch`. Remind the user to add relevant closed-access papers to Zotero.

Sources by role: `WebSearch` for trends, reviews, and terminology; `WebFetch` on arXiv / PubMed / publisher pages for open-access primary sources and metadata; Zotero MCP for the user's own library, annotations, and notes. For journal articles the **Crossref REST API** (`WebFetch https://api.crossref.org/works/<DOI>`) is the highest-signal existence+metadata check — it returns clean JSON (title / first author / year / venue), more reliable than parsing a publisher HTML page.

Organize candidates by role: background/context, current state-of-the-art, gap-identifying, methodology, and related work.

### Verification gate (do not skip)

Before any source is eligible to be cited:

1. Verify each candidate's **existence, first author, and year** against a first source (DOI/PMID/arXiv page, or Zotero metadata) — Rules 1, 2, 5 of [references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md](references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md).
2. Only take specific findings/numbers from sources whose full text or abstract you actually accessed. Do not write internal results for a paper you could not open.
3. Present the **verified candidate list** (title, author, year, source/DOI) to the user for a quick sanity check before outlining.

Anything that cannot be verified does not enter the reference pool; if the user insists on a half-remembered source, flag it `[UNVERIFIED]`.

**Non-interactive / headless runs.** If the skill is invoked without an interactive user (a background agent or pipeline), do not deadlock on step 3: record the verified candidate list inline in the deliverable (or a companion `citation_verification_log.md`) and continue. The recorded list is the audit trail in lieu of a live sanity check.

---

## Phase 3: Outline Generation

Read [references/STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md](references/STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md) and [references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md](references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md) for section-by-section and domain guidance.

### Standard Outline (default scenario)

```markdown
# [Research Title]

## Abstract (150-300 words, 5-10%) — background, questions, methodology overview, significance
## 1. Introduction (500-800 words, 15-20%) — background, problem, questions/objectives, scope
## 2. Literature Review (500-1000 words, 20-25%) — framework, current state, gap, positioning
## 3. Methodology (500-800 words, 20-25%) — design, data collection, analysis, validity/limitations
## 4. Timeline (200-300 words, 5-10%) — phases, milestones, optional Gantt
## 5. Significance and Expected Contributions (200-400 words, 10-15%) — theoretical, practical, broader impact
## References — cite what the argument needs (see CITATION_INTEGRITY.md); no minimum, no padding
```

Add a **Chapter Outline** section for humanities proposals. Do NOT include appendices — integrate essential content into the body.

### Approval gate (RED LINE)

**Present the outline and wait for explicit user approval before Phase 4. Do not start writing content on an unapproved outline.**

Ask whether the structure, section emphasis, and scope are acceptable, and whether to add/remove/modify sections.

**If the user says "you decide" / "你看着办" / defers:** state the assumptions you are locking in (scenario, domain, section set, target length, language), present the concrete outline once more as the decision, and proceed only after that — treat silence-plus-deferral as approval of *that stated* outline, but still surface the assumptions so the user can veto.

**If there is no interactive user at all** (headless/agent run): record the locked assumptions and the outline inline in the deliverable and treat that recorded outline as approved. This keeps the audit trail without deadlocking on an approval that no one can give.

---

## Phase 4: Content Writing (write-with-verify)

Load the scaffold as the writing skeleton and fill it section by section:

- English → [assets/proposal_scaffold_en.md](assets/proposal_scaffold_en.md)
- 中文 → [assets/proposal_scaffold_zh.md](assets/proposal_scaffold_zh.md)

Read [references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md) and apply it. Key hard rules from it: prose over lists; hedge to evidence; PEEL paragraphs (point → evidence+citation → explanation → link); define abbreviations on first use ("coronary CT angiography (CCTA)"); integrate citations into sentences.

**Write-with-verify loop — repeat per section:**

1. Draft the section as connected prose, placing `(Author, Year)` citations only from the Phase 2 verified pool.
2. Immediately verify that section's citations: each in-text `(Author, Year)` has a matching References entry (Rule 3), and every directional/quantitative claim matches its source (Rule 4). See [references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md](references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md).
3. Self-check against the LLM tells (Core Principles) and the hallucination red flags in CITATION_INTEGRITY.md.
4. Fix any failure in place before starting the next section. Do not accumulate unverified citations across sections.

**Citation style by domain:** STEM/Social Sciences → APA (Author, Year); Humanities → MLA or Chicago; 中文 → GB/T 7714. Keep one style consistent throughout.

**Figures:** suggest 3–5 figures at appropriate locations (not in the Abstract), each with a title, content description, and style note. Format and placement guidance is in [references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**中文 output:** 规范学术语体；hedging（"本研究旨在探讨…" 而非 "本研究将证明…"）；参考文献遵循 GB/T 7714。

---

## Phase 5: Output and Review

Save as `proposal_{topic_slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` in the user's working directory.

Verify against [references/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md](references/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md). Before delivering, the **citation gate** must pass:

- `grep -nE "xxx|XXXX|\[TBD\]|\[UNVERIFIED\]|10\.xxxx|\[.*占位.*\]"` returns 0 hits — or every remaining `[UNVERIFIED]` has been explicitly disclosed to the user and never presented as confirmed.
- Every in-text `(Author, Year)` reconciles with the References list (no orphans either direction).
- At least 20% of references, and every quantitative/directional claim, spot-checked against sources.
- No placeholder `[brackets]` or "TBD" left in the body — **except** applicant-specific scaffold fields the user must personalize (`[University/Institution Name]`, `[Your Field]`, `[Month Year]`) and `[Figure N Suggestion]` labels, which are intentional and may remain.

Offer format conversion:

```bash
pandoc proposal.md -o proposal.docx        # Word
pandoc proposal.md -o proposal.pdf         # PDF (needs LaTeX)
```

## Workflow Summary

Phase 1 Requirements (interactive) → Phase 2 Literature + verification gate → Phase 3 Outline + **approval red line** → Phase 4 Content, section-by-section **write-with-verify** → Phase 5 Output + citation gate + checklist.

---

## Error Handling

- **No Zotero results / MCP unavailable** — inform the user, fall back to `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` on open-access sources, suggest adding papers to Zotero and retrying.
- **A reference cannot be verified / looks fabricated** — do not write it into the References list. Flag `[UNVERIFIED]` inline and tell the user; never invent a DOI or author list to complete it.
- **Topic too vague** — ask clarifying questions; narrow scope; offer well-formed research-question examples.
- **Over the word limit** — prioritize Introduction and Methodology; condense the literature review to the load-bearing citations; offer an expanded version as a separate file.

## Version Notes

v2.0.0 was rewritten after diagnosis found the v1.0.0 skill generated many references with **zero authenticity guardrails**, a one-shot generation step, a hard "minimum 40 references" gate that incentivized padding, and internally contradictory numbers.

| Earlier failure (v1.0.0) | Current fix (v2.0.0) |
|---|---|
| No citation verification anywhere | Added [CITATION_INTEGRITY.md](references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md) with 5 rules; gates in Phase 2/4/5 |
| Hard "minimum 40 references" | Removed; "cite what the argument needs; typically 25–50; never pad" |
| Phase 4 = one-shot generation | Replaced with section-by-section write-with-verify |
| No literature-verification gate before writing | Phase 2 verify-before-cite + user sanity check |
| Contradictory numbers (40/30-50 refs, 60%/80% recency) | Unified: no minimum; ~60% recent where the field moves fast |
| Scaffolds never loaded by the workflow | Phase 4 explicitly loads `assets/proposal_scaffold_{en,zh}.md` |
| AI-tell sentence templates provided as models | Removed; added "avoid the LLM tells" guidance |
| Outline approval implicit | Made a red line, with "你看着办" handling |
| `Task` tool declared but unused; `WebFetch` missing | Removed `Task`; added `WebFetch` |
| Coronary-imaging examples throughout | Diluted with cross-domain examples; added computational/ML sub-template |
| Bulleted contributions in scaffolds vs prose-first rule | Scaffolds now demonstrate prose contributions/implications |
