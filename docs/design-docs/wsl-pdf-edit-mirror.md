# WSL PDF Edit Mirror

Status: Current authority

Last Updated: 2026-07-14

## Decision

When the local Library WebUI runs in WSL and opens a PDF through the Windows default application, ScholarAIO uses one stable Windows-side edit mirror instead of a disposable `%TEMP%` copy. Valid saved changes are reconciled automatically with the canonical PDF in `data/libraries/`.

Native Windows, macOS, and Linux launch the canonical local file directly. Remote or non-loopback WebUI deployments continue to deliver a browser download. The mirror protocol does not apply to annotations stored outside the PDF in proprietary reader state.

## Durable layout

- Windows edit mirror: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ScholarAIO\editable-pdfs\<library-kind>\<sync-id>\<display-name>.pdf`
- Synchronization database: `data/state/pdf-edit-mirror/sync.db`
- One-generation recovery copy: `data/state/pdf-edit-mirror/backups/<sync-id>.pdf`

The opaque sync ID remains stable across launches and ordinary paper-directory renames. The display filename is sanitized but readable. Managed paths are server-derived; browser requests continue to contain only stable paper IDs.

## Reconciliation contract

Polling observes existence, size, nanosecond mtime, and inode so it detects both in-place writes and save-via-rename. A changed file must remain stable across two observations before background synchronization. Before either side can replace the other it must be a regular non-symlink file below its expected root, begin with a PDF header, contain an EOF marker in the bounded trailing window, and remain unchanged while being hashed. PyMuPDF or pikepdf adds a deep page-open check when installed but is not a base dependency.

The last common hash decides which sides changed. A one-sided change wins. When both changed, the newer `mtime_ns` wins; equal times prefer the Windows mirror. Copies preserve the winning mtime, validate a temporary destination, flush it, and use `os.replace`. The valid losing file rotates into the single recovery slot immediately before replacement.

A malformed or partial mirror never replaces a valid canonical PDF. Missing mirrors are recreated; an accidentally missing canonical PDF is restored only while its library record still resolves. If both active files are unavailable, the last valid recovery copy may restore them. Advisory per-entry locks and SQLite immediate transactions make repeated or multi-server reconciliation idempotent.

## Lifecycle and deletion

The WebUI owns a background monitor. Persistent hashes allow edits made while the WebUI is stopped to reconcile after restart. Retryable I/O failures use bounded exponential backoff.

If the paper record no longer resolves by current ID, durable identity, or an unambiguous rename, the mapping is retired instead of restoring its mirror into the library. Ambiguous rebinds pause without writing. Retired mirrors, recovery copies, locks, and rows are removed after a seven-day grace period.

## HTTP and user experience

The existing loopback, exact-origin, CSRF, request-size, and stable-ID protections remain on `POST /api/main/open-pdf` and `POST /api/proceedings/open-pdf`. Detail payloads include `pdf_sync`, and `GET /api/<source>/pdf-sync?id=<paper-id>` refreshes the same path-free status object.

`not_opened` and `in_sync` are visually silent. `sync_pending` and `sync_failed` appear as non-modal Inspector status. If pre-launch reconciliation cannot establish a safe current mirror, the native-open request fails through the existing controlled error path so the browser downloads the canonical PDF instead.

This authority supersedes the earlier disposable Windows `%TEMP%\ScholarAIO` delivery behavior. Legacy random-prefixed files remain cleanup-only inputs and are never synchronized into the library.
