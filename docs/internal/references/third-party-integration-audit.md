# ScholarAIO Third-Party Integration Quality Audit

Status: Current integration inventory

Last Updated: 2026-08-30

This document records the quality, reachability, and output validation status of the third-party integrations, APIs, CLIs, and optional toolchains supported by ScholarAIO.

Dependency admission and Codex-native overlap decisions are maintained in
`code-and-dependency-technical-debt-audit.md`. This document remains the
workflow-evidence matrix; an integration is not promoted here merely because it
is retained as an optional capability there.

Integrations are evaluated at the workflow boundary, checking CLI/skill entrypoints, provider implementations, setup diagnostics, output formatting, fallback behaviors, and failure handling. A config test or a broad unit-test filename is not enough evidence to mark an integration surface as Good.

This audit is not a declaration that the full third-party toolchain is adapted or verified. Each row claims only the evidence listed in that row; everything else remains inventory until a focused live or workflow-boundary pass verifies it.

Status is intentionally conservative:

- **good**: workflow-boundary evidence exists, including commands, representative output, and failure handling.
- **partially-reviewed**: code-level or fixture evidence exists, but live workflow evidence is still missing.
- **not-yet-reviewed**: inventory only; no quality claim is made.

## 2. Removed Surfaces

The next-major breaking cleanup removes qt-web-extractor, the dormant
GUILessBingSearch compatibility adapter, and Paper2Any after they failed the
current admission gate. ScholarAIO no longer owns their MCP registration,
skills, CLI commands, configuration, setup diagnostics, providers, or live
canaries. Past validation reports remain unchanged because they describe
released historical versions.

## 3. Not-Yet-Reviewed Inventory

Rows marked `not-yet-reviewed` in the matrix are intentionally inventory-only. Promoting any of them to `partially-reviewed` or `good` should happen in a focused follow-up that includes:

- exact CLI command or skill workflow exercised;
- relevant config/version boundaries;
- representative success output;
- failure-mode behavior;
- targeted tests or reproducible smoke evidence.
